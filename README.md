# Bluetooth Control Button ðŸŽ§

Elevate your Bluetooth-listening experience. Introducing a dynamic tool that seamlessly integrates your Bluetooth devices's play button with virtually any application. If you're listening to your favorite tunes, podcasts or audiobooks with programs that don't use Bluetooth media controls, this software will ensure that you're always in control. Just click the big Bluetooth button to start controlling your favorite programs using your Bluetooth device.

## Features ðŸŒŸ
- **Universal Compatibility**: Integrate with any application, offering flexibility like never before.
- **Custom Audio Sessions**: Even though a default 10-minute silent "audio.wav" track is made and used to connect your Bluetooth inputs with your desired program, feel free to replace it with your personal preference.
- **Customizable Controls**: The default action is set to "pause" (spacebar), but you can click the label and customize it to use any key on your keyboard, catering to your specific needs.
- **Windows-Friendly**: Built using the Windows API, this tool is optimized for Windows users.
